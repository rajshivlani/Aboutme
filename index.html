          <p style="font-size: xx-large;">Hi<p><br>
              I am a teen studying in class 11th and wish to pursue my carrer in Computers.
              <br><br>I started coding since i was 11 years old. I completed a 145 class course with WhiteHat Jr. at the age
              of
              13
              <br><br>I aspire to one day to complete a project that helps thousands of people and make their life easier.
              <br><br>I have been learning to code by myself. I have learnt a lot about HTML CSS & JS without any
              help from any teacher. I believe that coding can't be learnt, it is an art of how well you can communicate
              with the
              machince and make something magnificent. Programming launguages are just launguages but a person who loves
              coding
              will never check twice to make sure his code looks neat or presentable because he will be more busy making
              his
              project better and easy to use. There are just so many types of jobs in the Information Technology field
              that one can
              never
              learn
              all them. There are more than 700 programming launguages each having their own spark and something fresh
              to
              explore, I aspire to learn these launguages till the day I can type.
